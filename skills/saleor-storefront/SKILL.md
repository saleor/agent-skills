# Saleor Storefront

Universal guide for building storefronts on the Saleor e-commerce platform. Covers
the Saleor GraphQL API data model, permission system, checkout lifecycle, channel
architecture, and product/variant patterns. Framework-agnostic — these rules apply
whether you're using Next.js, Remix, Nuxt, or a custom setup.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Querying Saleor's GraphQL API for products, categories, or collections
- Building product detail pages with variant selection
- Implementing checkout and payment flows
- Working with multi-channel and multi-currency setups
- Debugging "product not purchasable" or permission errors
- Investigating Saleor API behavior via source code

## Rule Categories

| Priority | Category  | Impact   | Prefix       |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ------------ |
| 1        | API       | CRITICAL | `api-`       |
| 2        | Products  | HIGH     | `products-`  |
| 3        | Checkout  | HIGH     | `checkout-`  |
| 4        | Channels  | MEDIUM   | `channels-`  |

## Quick Reference

- `api-permissions` — Token types, permission errors, two-tier query pattern
- `api-graphql-patterns` — Channel-scoped queries, variant attributes, filtering, codegen
- `api-investigation` — How to investigate Saleor API behavior via types and source

### 2. Products (HIGH)

- `products-variants` — Variant model, selection vs non-selection attributes, pricing, UX patterns

### 3. Checkout (HIGH)

- `checkout-lifecycle` — Session lifecycle, common errors, debugging payment issues

### 4. Channels (MEDIUM)

- `channels-purchasability` — Fulfillment triangle, 7-point purchasability checklist, channel queries
